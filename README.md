# Expense Tracking App (Level 2)

It is an enhanced version of [Expense Tracking App (Level 1)](https://github.com/BerkErdgn/Expense-Tracking-App--Level1-). In addition, data is stored in Firebase.

This application was designed to help users with their personal finance methods. The application also helps users to keep track of their budgets. By manually recording their income and expenses in the app, users can see how much money they've spent and how much they've saved whenever they want. The app can also help users identify where their spending is going and where they can save money.

The purpose of this application is to learn how to use Firebase and create graphs. In this application users' data is kept Firebase servers. In this way, they can see and add their data from any android device they want. And thanks to the chart on the homepage, they observe how much they spend and how much they earn.
